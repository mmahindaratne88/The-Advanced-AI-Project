Given that this Flask app is still under develeopment, and uses a development server rather than a dedicated domain, and server where a form submission endpoints can be, and given the constraints on less secure access, and third-paty use of a email server to which form submissions can be sent, for now, it seems logical for the forms to be locally stored in a text file in the root directory of the Flask app.
